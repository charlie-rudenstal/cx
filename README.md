Views
==

There are three ways to define a View:

Using a function:

	function Menu() {

	}

	Menu.prototype.onSelectItem = function(data, e) {
		console.log('Item selected with params', data, 'Menu element', this.elm);
	}

	cx.view('menu', Menu);

Using an object directly in the register function:

	cx.view('menu', {
		onSelectItem: function(data, e) {
			console.log('Item selected with params', data, 'Menu element: ', this.elm);
		}
	};

Or using a function directly in the register function:

	cx.view('menu', function() {
		this.onItemClick = function() {
			console.log('Item selected with params', data, 'Menu element: ', this.elm);
    	};
	});

If an object is passed to cx.view an empty function will be created and the methods
on the object will be moved over to its prototype. This will give your methods access to
a 'this' context that points to your view.

The view object contains the 'elm' property which points to the HTML element that the
current view instance is working with. It also contains the following helpers methods:

- findArea(name)
	Will return the first element in the current view with a _data-area_ value
	that matches the name supplied.

In addition events can be triggered using the data-action attribute. When an element with
a data-action attribute is clicked the event will be routed to its corresponding camel-cased
method in the view. A click on a the following div:

	<div data-view='foo'>
		<div data-action='pressed'>Press me</div>
	</div>

Will trigger the method in the following example view:

	cx.view('foo', {
		onPressed: function(data, e) {
			e.target.innerHTML = 'I was pressed!';
		}
	});

Parameters can be passed using data attributes:

	<div data-view='foo'>
		<div data-action='pressed' data-name='first'>Press me!</div>
		<div data-action='pressed' data-name='second'>No, press me!</div>
	</div>

And

	cx.view('foo', {
		onPressed: function(data, e) {
			this.elm.innerHTML = data.name + ' was pressed!';
		}
	});

The following tab module is an example of these concepts working together

Javascript:

	cx.view('tabs', {
		onSelect: function() {
			this.findArea('body').innerHTML = this.findArea(data.target).innerHTML;
		}
	});

HTML:

	<div data-view="tabs">
        <div>
            <div data-action="select" data-target="tab1">Tab 1</div>
            <div data-action="select" data-target="tab2">Tab 2</div>
            <div data-action="select" data-target="tab3">Tab 3</div>
        </div>
        <div data-area="tab1" style="display: none">The first tab</div>
        <div data-area="tab2" style="display: none">The second tab</div>
        <div data-area="tab3" style="display: none">The third tab</div>
        <div data-area="body"></div>
    </div>
