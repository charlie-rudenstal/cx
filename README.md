Views

Definition
--
There are three ways to define a View:

#### By defining a function 
And pass it to the view function. This option makes it possible to define 
code to be run when the view is registered (inside the main function). 
If you need access to the views html element you will need to put your 
initialization code in the optional Menu.prototype.init() method 
where _this.elm_ will be available.

```
function Menu() {

}

Menu.prototype.onSelectItem = function(data, e) {
	console.log(data, this.elm);
}

cx.view('menu', Menu);
```

#### By providing an object
An empty function will be created and the methods on the object will be moved
over to its prototype. This will give your methods access to a 'this' context
that points to your view.

```
cx.view('menu', {
	onSelectItem: function(data, e) {
		console.log(data, this.elm);
	}
};
```

#### By providing an anonymous function
And pass it directly to the view function. This is the least performant option since this function
will be redefined for every instance of the view that is created.

```
cx.view('menu', function() {
	this.onSelectItem = function() {
		console.log(data, this.elm);
	};
});
```

The view object contains the 'elm' property which points to the HTML element that the
current view instance is working with.

Actions
--
Events can be triggered using the data-action attribute. When an element with
a data-action attribute is clicked the event will be routed to its corresponding camel-cased
method in the view. A click on a the following div:

	<div data-view='foo'>
		<div data-action='pressed'>Press me</div>
	</div>

Will trigger the method in the following example view:

	cx.view('foo', {
		onPressed: function(data, e) {
			e.target.innerHTML = 'I was pressed!';
		}
	});

#### Parameters
Parameters can be passed using data attributes:

	<div data-view='foo'>
		<div data-action='pressed' data-name='first'>Press me!</div>
		<div data-action='pressed' data-name='second'>No, press me!</div>
	</div>

And

	cx.view('foo', {
		onPressed: function(data, e) {
			this.elm.innerHTML = data.name + ' was pressed!';
		}
	});

Areas
--
By putting a data-area attribute on an element in your view you can make it
easily referenceable from your View code:

	<div data-view="foo">
		<div data-area='myArea'></div>
	</div>

And

	cx.view('foo', {
		init: function() {
			this.area('myArea').innerHTML = 'foobar';
		}
	});

The area method will return the first element in the current view with a _data-area_ value
that matches the name supplied. If a second parameter is supplied the area's innerHTML will be set to that parameter's value. A promise or another element (such as another area) can also be passed:

	this.area('myArea', 'myValue'); // pure value
	this.area('myArea', cx.get('/myArea/1')); // promise
	this.area('myArea', this.area('anotherArea')); // another element

Example
--

The following tab module is an example of these concepts working together

HTML:

	<div data-view="tabs">
        <div>
            <div data-action="select-tab" data-target="tab1">Tab 1</div>
            <div data-action="select-tab" data-target="tab2">Tab 2</div>
            <div data-action="select-tab" data-target="tab3">Tab 3</div>
        </div>
        <div data-area="tab1" style="display: none">The first tab</div>
        <div data-area="tab2" style="display: none">The second tab</div>
        <div data-area="tab3" style="display: none">The third tab</div>
        <div data-area="body"></div>
    </div>

Javascript:

	cx.view('tabs', {
		onSelectTab: function() {
			this.area('body', this.area(data.target));
		}
	});
